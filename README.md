# Bar Chart Race

A [bar chart race demo](https://bar-chart-race.yishan.toys) built with [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) and [vx](https://vx-demo.now.sh/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chenesan/bar-chart-race

npm install
```

## Development

```sh
npm run start # running app in development mode on port 3000.
```

Note that in development mode the animation might be janky on mid-end mobile.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
serve -s build # running built app on port 5000.
```

## Future

Maybe extract the core chart racing code as npm package if I have time.# covid-race-bar
